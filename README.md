# Climbox
An e-commerce for climbing equipments.

## Motivation
It was the final project of the fifth sprint of Laboratoria bootcamp. The requirement was to create a SPA (Single Page Application), with free theme, consuming at least one API. 

Observing how much tech companies are using React, I set myself the challenge of learning and applying it in this project.
